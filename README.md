SecureTypes
===========

A small project I always had in mind. Imagine you have a memdump of your running java-project. What happens if there are clear data of passwords and usernames and other stuff? So, why not encrypt it on-the-fly and store only the encrypted data in the ram. If you need it, you can decrypt it in time.
